Linux 

In realtime we will be using linux OS only to setup infrastructure required to run our application
- Linux os is not only for administrators, 
	- even developers, testers, will also be working on linux os in real time to monitor our application and application servers.

History of Linux
- UNIX 
- linus, he suggested his changes to unix.
- and finally created his own os
- he used minux os, (Linus + minux = Linux)
- He released the OS source code for all. (open source operating system)

- As it is open source, many companies and people modify according to their needs and requirement and release them into market with different names
- ubuntu os, redhat, cent OS, Fedora, Kali linux, debian, open sesu, etc
- Linux setup
	- Use virtual box (with hypervisor)
	- Use cloud
	- Have parallel OS.

- Atleast 2 projects.


In linux, everything will be represented as file.
we have 3 types of files
- ordinary file(normal file)
- Directory file
- Link file


LINUX

1) whoami
	- to check username of current user.
2) pwd 
	-> present working directory
3) date
	-> display date
4) cal 
	-> display calender
5) touch
	-> creating new file
	-> $ touch ram.txt

6) ls
	-> list directories or files (to display flies in current workspace)
	-> $ ls

7) mkdir
	-> create new directory
	-> $ mkdir spirituality

8) ls -a
	-> it will display all files including hidden files.

9) code .
	-> It will open code editor

10) cat
	-> it stands for concatenate
	-> to create a file with data
	-> $ cat > radha.txt
		-> write something, and then
		-> "ctrl + D"
	-> $ cat radha.txt
	-> $ cat >> radha.txt
		-> to append to current text
	-> $ cat > radha.txt
		-> it will edit the file.
11) rm
	-> to remove the file
	-> $ rm filename.txt

12) rmdir 
	-> remove empty directory
	-> $ rmdir <directory-name>
	-> to remove non-empty directory
		-> $ rm -r <directory-name>

13) history
	-> It shows what all commands we have excecuted

14) clear
	-> It clears the terminal completely.

 "ctrl + l" -> It will align the present commands.

15) Options of 'ls' command
$ ls (will display files in alphabetical order)
$ ls -a (will show all the files)
$ ls -r (will display files in reverse of alphabetical order)
$ ls -l (It will display long listing of files)
$ ls -t (It will display file with last modified date and time)
$ ls -lr (combination of both the command)
Note: order doesn't matter in combinations of the commands.

in "ls -l"
	-> all files are starting with hyphen(-)
	-> and all directoriies starts with "d"
16) ls <directory-name>
	-> will display all the files inside the directory

17) cd 
	-> change directory
	-> $ cd <directory-name>
$ cd .. (to come out of directory)


18) to see file content with line number
$ cat -n filename.txt

19) to create multiple files with one command
$ touch f1.txt f2.txt

20) Copy data from one file to another
$ cat radha.txt > f1.txt

21) To reverse the content in the file(last line at top)
$ tac radha.txt

22) To reverse the content of each line. 
$ rev radha.txt

23) head
	-> head command will display data from top(default 10 lines)
	-> $ head <filename>
	-> $ head -n 13 <filename> 
		-> it will show data upto 13 lines

24) tail 
	->  same thing from bottom
	-> $ tail -n 13 radha.txt
		-> it will show last 13 lines.
	-> by default it will show, last 10 lines.

25) wc
	-> word count
	-> $ wc radha.txt
	-> 15  21 164 radha.txt
		-> 15 is number of lines
		-> 21 is total number of words
		-> 164 is total number of character

26) copy
$ cp m2.txt m1.txt (copy data in m2 in m1)
(we cannot copy from multiple commands into one)

we can do that using cat
$ cat m2.txt m3.txt >> m1.txt (it will append the data from m2 and m3 file into m1)


27) Rename
$ mv m3.txt m5.txt (it will rename m3.txt as m5.txt)

We can use this command for renaming and moving the files
$ mv f2.txt spirituality/


28) Comparing the files
$ cmp f1.txt f2.txt 
$ diff f1.txt f2.txt (it will display difference)
